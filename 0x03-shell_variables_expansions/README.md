# Shell Variables and Expansions - Task README

This repository contains my solutions for the tasks related to shell variables and expansions.

## Task 0: Create an Alias

In this task, I created a script that sets up an alias using the `alias` command. The alias `ls` is associated with the command `rm *`, which effectively deletes all files in the current directory.

- `0-alias`: This script creates the `ls` alias with the value `rm *`.

## Task 1: Hello You

For this task, I created a script that prints "hello" followed by the current Linux user's name.

- `1-hello_you`: This script retrieves the current Linux user's name and displays the greeting.

## Task 2: The Path to Success is to Take Massive, Determined Action

In this task, I created a script that appends the directory `/action` to the `PATH` environment variable. This ensures that `/action` is the last directory searched when the shell looks for a program.

- `2-path`: This script modifies the `PATH` environment variable by adding `/action` at the end.

## Task 3: If the Path Be Beautiful, Let Us Not Ask Where It Leads

In this task, I created a script that counts the number of directories in the `PATH` environment variable.

- `3-paths`: This script counts and displays the number of directories in the `PATH` variable.

## Task 4: Global Variables

Here, I created a script that lists environment variables.

- `4-global_variables`: This script lists all the environment variables.

## Task 5: Local Variables

For this task, I created a script that lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions.

- `5-local_variables`: This script lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions.

## Task 6: Local Variable

In this task, I created a script that creates a new local variable.

- `6-create_local_variable`: This script creates a new local variable named `BEST` with the value `School`.

## Task 7: Global Variable

Here, I created a script that creates a new global variable.

- `7-create_global_variable`: This script creates a new global variable named `BEST` with the value `School`.

Feel free to modify and test the scripts as needed. If you have any questions or face any issues, please let me know.

## Task 8: Every Addition to True Knowledge is an Addition to Human Power

Write a script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line.

- `8-true_knowledge`: This script adds 128 to the value of the `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` environment variable and displays the result.

## Task 9: Divide and Rule

Write a script that prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line. Both `POWER` and `DIVIDE` are environment variables.

- `9-divide_and_rule`: This script divides the value of `POWER` by the value of `DIVIDE` and displays the result.

## Task 10: Love is Anterior to Life, Posterior to Death, Initial of Creation, and the Exponent of Breath

Write a script that displays the result of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`. Both `BREATH` and `LOVE` are environment variables. The script should display the result, followed by a new line.

- `10-love_exponent_breath`: This script calculates and displays the result of raising `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`.

## Task 11: There are 10 Types of People in the World - Those Who Understand Binary, and Those Who Don't

Write a script that converts a number from base 2 to base 10. The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable `BINARY`. The script should display the number in base 10, followed by a new line.

- `11-binary_to_decimal`: This script converts the number stored in `BINARY` from base 2 to base 10 and displays the result.

## Task 12: Combination

Create a script that prints all possible combinations of two letters (lowercase), except for "oo". Each combination should be displayed on a separate line. The output should be alpha-ordered, starting with "aa". The script file should contain a maximum of 64 characters.

- `12-combinations`: This script generates and displays all possible combinations of two lowercase letters, excluding "oo".

## Task 13: Floats

Write a script that prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line. The number will be stored in the environment variable `NUM`.

- `13-print_float`: This script prints the value of `NUM` with two decimal places.

Feel free to modify and test the scripts as needed. If you have any questions or face any issues, please let me know.
